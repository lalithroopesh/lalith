                    <p>Hello! I am a second-year undergraduate student at the University of South Florida, pursuing a 7-year BS/MD track. My goals include making something new and making it last, so feel free to see the Projects or Involvement pages for progress. In the meantime, I enjoy hiking, reading, and cooking. Feel free to contact me for anything!</p>

                    <h2><i>About this website</i></h2>
                    <p>This website was made from scratch using HTML5/CSS/JS on VS Code and deployed using Github Pages and Google Domains, and big thanks to W3Schools and StackExchange for knowledge. Use a laptop, haven't done mobile-friendly formatting yet!</p>

            <p>I think Update Posts should refer both to updates in what I'm doing (as well as what I want to rope everyone else into) and some basic website updates. Here's both!</p>
            <p style="color:lightblue">Involvement and Opportunities for USF students!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bulls Science Olympiad is looking for volunteers to help write science tests for a K-12 STEM competition we are hosting virtually from USF! No prior experience with Science Olympiad is needed, and you only need an interest in STEM to be able to write. We offer volunteer hours and merch for writing, supervising virtually, and grading. To sign up, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/4yn4JGT228ds3ubG7" target="_blank">this form</a>. We are also hosting a <a href="https://cglink.me/2k5/r1893486" target="_blank">Test-Writing Workshop</a> on November 8th in collaboration with SASE, and it'd be great if you can attend!</li>
                <li>EBC is hosting a research seminar on November 22nd at the Oval Theater in collaboration with URS to both exhibit USF students' projects and introduce students to ways to get into research! We are looking for presenters, so if you have research to present, feel free to sign-up via <a href="https://forms.gle/hXwNVHJGk547yBpN6" target="_blank">this form</a>. If you are just interested in attending, here is the <a href="https://cglink.me/2k5/r1888271" target="_blank">BullsConnect event link</a> with more details and an RSVP.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color:lightblue">Website Updates!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created Basic Molecule Viewer project at my <a href="./experimental/molviewer.html">MolViewer page</a> using jQuery, WebGL, and the NGLViewer library. I will be working on it further to add more functionality so it is useful in comparison to other viewers.</li>
                <li>Addition of the <a href="./involvement.html">Involvement page</a>.</li>
                <li>Addition of the Neurotransmitters project to the <a href="./projects.html">Projects page</a>.</li>
                <li>Small-scale implementation of the above MolViewer to the <a href="./projects.html">Projects page</a>.</li> 
                <li>Slight edits to multiple paragraphs.</li>
                <li>Addition of meta tags and a sitemap for SEO optimization, but will need more work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1><b>10/21/2022:</b> Hello world!</h1>
            <p>This marks the first creation of this iteration of my website! It is actually somewhat put together and I am actively learning (well, re-learning) my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. I think that website-building coding languages are somewhat dead due to the sheer amount of website creation sites and services, but it is a good skill to know if you need to make modifications, which I have many times. Custom sites are especially common in academia, from very drab .edu lecture notes repositories to "meet the team"s upheld by individual research labs. As for me, this is just a fun project and a great place to write down and easily access what I'm doing. I'll also be using it as a testing grounds for anything else I can host, so feel free to check back whenever!</p>
