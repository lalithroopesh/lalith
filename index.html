                    <p>Hello! I am a second-year undergraduate student at the University of South Florida, pursuing a 7-year BS/MD track. To learn more about what I do at USF, check out my Projects or Involvement pages! In my increasingly rare time off, I enjoy hiking, reading, and cooking. Feel free to contact me for anything!</p>

                    <h2><i>About this website</i></h2>
                    <p>This website was made from scratch using HTML5/CSS/JS on VS Code and deployed using Github Pages and Google Domains, and big thanks to W3Schools and StackExchange for knowledge. Use a laptop, haven't done mobile-friendly formatting yet!</p>

            <h1><b>10/21/2022:</b> Hello world!</h1>
            <p>This marks the first creation of this iteration of my website! It is actually somewhat put together and I am actively learning (well, re-learning) my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. I think that website-building coding languages are somewhat dead due to the sheer amount of website creation sites and services, but it is a good skill to know if you need to make modifications, which I have many times. Custom sites are especially common in academia, from very drab .edu lecture notes repositories to "meet the team"s upheld by individual research labs. As for me, this is just a fun project and a great place to write down and easily access what I'm doing. I'll also be using it as a testing grounds for anything else I can host, so feel free to check back whenever!</p>
