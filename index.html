            <ul>
                <li>Presented project at the 2023 Castle Conference at USF. Read more <a href="./projects.html" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>
                <li>The Engineering Biology Core x Undergraduate Research Ceremony Year-End Seminar, which I co-hosted and presented at, was also amazing! We got to see presentations from ONS, HIPUR, EBC, and URS, along with undergrad and grad student presentations on a variety of research. Check out full highlights at <a href="https://instagram.com/ebc.usf" target="_blank">@ebc.usf</a> on Instagram!</li>
                <li>Bulls Science Olympiad had an incredible tournament on 11/19/2022! Looking at it by the numbers: Over $5500 raised for the club, 925 students competed, 77 teams, 13 different states, 35 events, 32 volunteers/writers, 10 hours on-call (MANY more writing tests and grading), and 96 donuts consumed. Overall, a huge success! Our Awards Ceremony will be at 4 pm EST on 11/30/2022, so check it out <a href="https://home.bullso.org/invitational" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>

            <p style="color:lightblue">Website Updates!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Updates to the the <a href="./projects.html">Projects page</a> detailing status of current projects.</li>
                <li>Considerable formatting changes for images and built-in content.</li>
                <li>In-browser Python IDE at my <a href="./experimental/python.html">Python IDE page</a>! It's just an embed pointing to the <a href="https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">JupyterLite initiative</a>, but is very convenient for the times I need a task automated but don't have Python installed.</li>
