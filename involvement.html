            <h1>Bulls Science Olympiad </h1>
            <h2><i>August 2022 - Present:</i> Founder and President</h2>
            <p>Bulls Science Olympiad is a registered USF student organization whose mission is to further STEM education for high and middle school students. We aim to host a Science Olympiad tournament at USF and volunteer in person at the regional competition at HCC and the state competition at UF. After the success of our virtual invitational with 900+ attendees in 2023, we ran an amazing in-person competition with 250+ high school attendees and 60+ volunteers at USF on January 27th, 2024 (left). Check out the links below to read more!</p>

My position oversees all branches, specializing in starting new initiatives. My aim is to create a community of like-minded individuals dedicated to research to encourage collaboration, inspiration, and creating teams to do good work. To this end, I recently directed the SABER conference at USF (right) and was a research lead on our MCPyV Host Interactions and Neurotransmitters projects.</p>

            <p>The Society of Asian Scientists & Engineers (SASE) is dedicated to the professional, academic, and social development of its members. My position oversees and delegates to most positions while also meeting 1-on-1 to keep the Executive Board running smoothly, creating a focus on goal-centered development of the organization and its individuals. I recently was able to create new science initiatives, gaining national attention, which allowed me to co-found and lead the first research symposium at the SASE National Convention. I hope to continue to develop the science side of SASE in the future.</p>

            <h2><i>June 2022 - October 2022: </i>Peer Mentor</h2>
            <p>This position entails working with a team of fellow Peer Mentor Leads (PMLs) to plan, create curricula, train teachers (Peer Mentors), and execute IDH 2930 Honors Foundations, a required class for all incoming students to the Judy Genshaft Honors College. We will work closely with Honors faculty and advisors to create an all-encompassing introductory experience to Honors and college in general for students. I would like to thank our new program director Kevin Lee for the opportunity.</p>

            <h1>Journal of Interdisciplinary Sciences & Technology (JIST)</h1>
            <h2><i>February 2023 - November 2023: </i>Financial Director</h2>
            <p>Much of the challenge in engaging students in research is they do not see a clear pathway. While we focus on building skills through workshops and even connecting students to labs / funding their own projects, publication is a goal that is still hard to attain. To this end, Engineering Biology Core and the Undergraduate Research Society have teamed up to release our own undergraduate journal targeted at USF undergraduates who have done good work.</p>

            <p>Settle Out USF is a club dedicated to fulfilling a huge USF need: get our diverse population used to Tampa and host fun events for people to get to know each other! We host a multitude of events at USF and take field trips to places around Tampa. As treasurer, I am responsible for budgeting, applying for funding, and working with Student Government and Student Business Services for every event. It was a great position to get used to USF bureaucracy that has set up my success in other endeavors.</p>
