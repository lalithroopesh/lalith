            <h1>Co-founder and Treasurer, Settle Out Club</h1>
            <h2><i>September 2021 - Present</i></h2>
            <p>Settle Out USF is a club dedicated to fulfilling a huge USF need: get our diverse population used to Tampa and host fun events for people to get to know each other! We host a multitude of events at USF and take field trips to places around Tampa. As treasurer, I am responsible for budgeting, applying for funding, and working with Student Government and Student Business Services for every event. It was a great position to get used to USF bureaucracy that has set up my success in other endeavors.</p>

            <h1>Other Notable Positions</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b style="color:lightblue">Honors Peer Mentor, Judy Genshaft Honors College (June 2022 - Present) </b>- As part of this position, I teach a section of IDH 2930 Honors Foundations, which is a required class for all freshmen in the Honors College. Over the summer, I worked with other peer mentors to create curricula and I teach once a week during the fall. Huge thanks to my Peer Mentor Lead Connor Murray and our program's Director Allison Cousino for this opportunity!</li>
                <li><b style="color:lightblue">Events Committee, Honors College Student Council (September 2022 - Present)</b> - As a part of the events committee, I help brainstorm and plan events for honors students throughout the year. These can range from trivia nights to park picnics, anything that helps form bonds within the honors community. </li>
                <li><b style="color:lightblue">Mayor, Juniper Hall Council (September 2021 - May 2022)</b> - Similar to the Honors Council Student Council, this position involved planning events for the residents of Juniper Hall. We also collaborated with the hall councils of Poplar and Magnolia residence halls to put on large events! This lead to the formation of this year's JAMP Area council, which unfortunately doesn't have a schedule that works well with me.</li>

            <h1>Science Olympiad Event Supervisor - Various Tournaments</h1>
            <h2><i>August 2021 - Present</i></h2>
            <p>I enjoy volunteering and being able to employ my experience at various Science Olympiad tournaments by writing tests or (usually if virtual) supervising and grading. Notable ones in 2021-22 include the National Tournament, Florida State Tournament, and New Jersey State Tournament virtually, along with being flown out to MIT in-person for their invitational. I plan to volunteer similarly this year in addition to Bulls Science Olympiad!</p>
