            <h1>Host Protein Interactions in Merkel Cell Polyomavirus</h1>
            <h2><i>October 2022 - Present: </i>Project Lead</h2>
            <p style="color:lightblue">This project was fully student-led and part of Engineering Biology Core's projects program.</p>
            <p>Previous EBC research identified Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) proteins that play an important role in the oncogenesis of Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC). This project will identify specific bindings between target proteins via a variety of bioinformatic tools to characterize these intereactions. The interactive model displays one of these proteins, VP1, used for attachment to host cell receptors. Possible methods will include genome mining, protein modeling, moelcular dynamics, molecular docking, disorder analysis, and more. Characterization of these relatively unnown interactions will contribute to knowledge and serve as a therapeutic basis.</p>

            <h1>An <i>In Silico</i> Comparative Study of Interspecies Variability in Neurotransmitter Ligand-Receptor Interactions</h1>
            <h2><i>October 2022 - March 2023: </i>Project Lead</h2>
            <p style="color:lightblue">This project was fully student-led and part of Engineering Biology Core's projects program.</p>
            <p>Research has shown that epigenetic regulation and spatial distribution of neurotransmitter receptors is linked to the expression of a variety of social behaviors and neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies on relevant receptor neurobiology have focused on signaling patterns as a therapeutic basis and have been successful in modulating behavior in several model organisms. Structure-based approaches may offer insight to molecular mechanisms contributing to observed irregularities in social behavior across species and contribute further investigation of neural circuitry. We examined receptors for dopamine (DRD1 and DRD2), oxytocin (OXTR1), and vasopressin (AVPR1) from a wide array of phylogenies totaling 465 proteins and conducted molecular docking with their respective ligand to compare binding affinity and other interactions. We highlight how this study contributes to our understanding of the role of receptor structure in broader neurobiological mechanisms and possible novel therapies.</p>

        <p class="s-subtitle"><b>It is important to note that these projects were completed <i>before</i> my professional academic career. While still done with the best of my ability at the time, with the exception of Project STEM, none of these should be considered serious academic research.</b></p>

            <h1><b>Summer 2021:</b> <i>Genomic Error Analysis at Eli Lilly</i></h1>
            <p>This opportunity was part of IUPUI's Project STEM program's collaboration with Eli Lilly, where after a competitive application/interview process some high school students were able to do virtual (due to COVID-19) research with Eli Lilly staff. My work consisted of sequencing multiple gene databases to do error analysis. While the specific nature of the work is confidential due to Eli Lilly guidelines, it involved using R to run supercomputer jobs and BLAST sequences. I would like to thank Dr. Simone Gupta for being an amazing mentor during my time with her, along with Mr. Sanders for running Project STEM and getting us in touch.</p>

            <h1><b>Summer 2020:</b> <i>COVID-19 Statistical Analysis with the Regenstrief Institute</i></h1>
            <p>This opportunity was done through IUPUI's Project STEM. My mentor, Dr. Eneida Mendonca, interviewed several candidates and selected me to work with her team on collecting and analyzing data from the then-new COVID-19 pandemic. My project involved using command line and Python to calculate COVID-19 comorbidity and ICU correlations from the INPC Hospital database of over 49,000 patients. This helped predict which patients would be likely to require hospitalization or admittance to the ICU along with the mortality rate. I would like to thank Dr. Mendonca for this opportunity, along with the rest of the Regenstrief team (Ms. Katie Allen, Dr. Siu Hui, and Mr. Jack Van Schaik) and Mr. Sanders.</p>

            <h1><b>Fall 2019/Spring 2020:</b> <i>Implementation of Technology in Classrooms</i></h1>
            <p>I did this study as part of the AP Research program, where I analyzed what characteristics of teachers' technology use are the strongest determiners of the level at which they implement technology in the classroom. While accessibility and the teacher's own use seemed to be determinative, the subject area was not. While the research is not very applicable to other schools due to its narrow score, it provides insight into the interactions between teachers, students, and technology. This project was meant to be an introduction to academic research, where the project required IRB approval, had proper statistic analyses, and resulted in a full academic paper. I would like to thank Ms. Allison Malloy and Mr. Matthew Wernke for their mentorship.</p>

            <h1><b>Summer 2019:</b> <i>Novel Cyclohexene Filtration Systems to Combat Parkinson's Risks</i></h1>
            <p>Working in certain industries has been correlated with higher rates of Parkinson's disease onset, and one important mechanism found is the oxidative effects of highly penetrative xylene and toluene in neurons. The goal of the project was to design a filter that would be effective in removing these molecules from the air. I was the project leader for this group, and we presented at Cummins Engineering, Eli Lilly, and IUPUI. While industry experts reviewed the idea as theoretically sound, our next steps include creating a prototype and further design. I would like to thank the people at Cummins and Eli Lilly for their time, and the staff at Health and Science Innovations for this opportunity and mentorship.</p>

            <h1>Other Notable Projects</h1> 
            <ul>
                <li><b style="color:lightblue">Summer 2020:</b> This may be better under Involvement, but it definitely felt like a project. Once COVID-19 hit, my friends and I wanted to invent a fully virtual STEM competition from scratch so that our teams (and other competitors across the nation) whose competitions just got canceled have a chance to use all their hard work. I managed logistics for the 2 tournaments we ran alongside coding a <a href="https://github.com/lalithroopesh/TOASTbot" target="_blank">chatbot using NodeJS</a> that could run speed-based trivia rounds on a communication platform called Discord. More information on this initiative <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ihssc/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
                <li><b style="color:lightblue">Summer 2019:</b> Using Legos, a Raspberry Pi, some basic electronic components, and Python, I built a machine that can take a medication schedule as input and dispense the proper medicine at the right time. It is designed for older generations, where the pharmacy industry has come up with ingenious ways to help them get the right medicine at the right time. Other features include sound and a flashing light as alerts. This was presented at the 2019 Indiana CoderDojo STEM Expo and won first place. An image of a prototype can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0ytREGb" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <li><b style="color:lightblue">Summer/Fall 2017:</b> This project was my first delve into academic research, where I wrote a comprehensive literature review on melanoma under the mentorship of Dr. Srikant Devaraj. As part of this opportunity, I was able to attend lectures led by doctors and researchers in the field, shadow oncologists, and tour the IU Health Cancer Research facility. The project culminated in a poster presentation of my research at the Rajyotsava Cancer Awareness and fundraiser event. I would like to thank all the lecturers and Dr. Devaraj for the opportunity.</li>
                <li><b style="color:lightblue">Summer 2017:</b> In experimenting with AI for the first time, I built an AI chess program completely in Python 3. The program used Conway's combinatorial game theory through a minimax algorithm with adjustable steps based on computation time and alpha-beta pruning. Heuristics were arbitrarily determined by me using some chess theory based on piece and placement value. While it did not beat me, it was still considerably strong. Future steps may include implementing machine learning, possibly with TensorFlow.</li>
                <li style="color:lightcyan">Other projects TBA as I remember them or find old files!</li>
